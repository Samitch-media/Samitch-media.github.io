                    <span>
                        After earning my degree, I had the privilege of joining Toyota Motor North America—a company
                        that had always topped my list of preferences. During the two-year post-graduate rotational
                        program, I immersed myself in four distinct business verticals where I focused on skills in
                        agile project management, data analytics, the Microsoft Power Platform, and
                        relationship-building across the organization.

                    <span>
                        Today, my capabilities extend beyond departmental boundaries. As part of the Cloud & Developer
                        Experience platform engineering group, I lead multiple teams, drive product features, and
                        contribute to critical engineering efforts. My current focus centers on engineering excellence
                        and compliance.
                        Through innovative tools, we empower application DevOps teams to adopt improved software
                        engineering practices, ultimately delivering greater value to the business.

                    <span>
                        Customer satisfaction remains at the core of my work. I strive to enhance user experiences by
                        delivering high-quality software solutions. As I continue to evolve in my role, I find
                        fulfillment in teaching others how these refined practices can yield efficiency gains and
                        elevate quality.

                    <span>
                        Beyond the confines of my computer screen, I cherish moments with my wonderful wife and our
                        two fluffy cats. Cooking provides a creative outlet, while fishing, boating, scuba diving, and
                        aviation fuel my adventurous spirit. And when I need solace, music—my perennial 'happy
                        place'—resonates deeply.

                    <span>
                        I have a wide range of interests and skills, but I'm eager to learn and deepen my expertise.
                        Pushing my limits excites me, and I look forward to continuous growth
